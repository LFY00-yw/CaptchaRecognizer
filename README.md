A naive captcha-recognition program
inspired by PHA(perceptual hash algorithm):

The current accuracy is below:

![ratio](./Ratios.png)

This chart shows that (24,24) is the best parameter to calculate hash value(You may see details in the code). Though the largest accuracy is only 55%...

# Q&A

Obviously neural network performs much better than PHA. 

SO what did I made this for? I made this just for __FUN__~  Furthermore, that's why this readme file is written in English ðŸ™ˆ 

If any other questions, you can refer to [Issues](https://github.com/clouduan/CaptchaRecognizer/issues).
