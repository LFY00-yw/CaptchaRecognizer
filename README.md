A naive captcha-recognition program
inspired by PHA(perceptual hash algorithm):

The current accuracy is below:

This chart shows that (24,24) is the best parameter to calculate hash value. Though the largest accuracy is only 55%...

# Q&A

Neural Network performs much better than PHA. 

SO what did I made this for? I made this just for FUN~
